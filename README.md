# Circulate-the-values-of-N-variables
## Aim:
To write a python program to circulate the n variables using function concept
## Equipmentâ€™s required:
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm: 
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
In circular swapping, the value of the first variable is assigned to the second variable
### Step 3: 
Get the value from the user for the number of rotation
### Step 4: 
Using the slicing concept rotate the list
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be circulated
### Step 6: 
End the program
## Program:
```# Program to circulate N values.
# Developed by: SAI GURUCHANDRAN G
# RegisterNumber:23014037
def circulate():
    n=eval(input())
    m=int(input())
    n=n[m:]+n[:m]
    print("After circulating the values are:",n)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the Circulation of the values of N variables are successfully executed
